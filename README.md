# CCNA-Lecture-01-Networking-Basics

As part of my CCNA training, I’ve compiled self-made notes from Lecture 1 covering:

🌐 Basics of Networking 
🔗 Network Topologies 
📡 Types of Data Transmission 

These notes are designed to be beginner-friendly yet technically solid—perfect for anyone starting their networking journey or revisiting foundational concepts. I’ve put effort into making them clear, structured, and easy to follow.

💡 Whether you're a fellow student, a cybersecurity enthusiast, or just curious about how networks operate, feel free to check them out and take advantage. Knowledge grows best when shared!

If you'd like access or want to collaborate on future notes, drop a comment. Let’s learn and grow together! 🚀
